 * Rewrites oxfmt's CLI to format embedded code in-process.
 *
 * oxfmt formats embedded code — Vue `<template>`/`<style>`, markdown fences,
 * HTML — by handing it to a Tinypool pool running with
 * `runtime: "child_process"`. That pool forks worker entry scripts which, in a
 * `bun build --compile` binary, exist only as virtual `/$bunfs/root/…` paths and
 * are never carved out as real files: every worker dies on startup and
 * `Tinypool.destroy()` then awaits an exit event that never fires, wedging the
 * process. Plain `.ts` never initialises the pool, which is why only files with
 * embedded code hang.
 *
 * The four pooled functions are stateless prettier calls, so the pool only ever
 * bought cross-file parallelism — not isolation. Calling them directly is
 * therefore behaviourally identical, minus the worker layer that cannot work
 * here. For the embedded-code fraction of a codebase the lost parallelism is
 * negligible, and the per-worker prettier startup cost disappears with it.
 *
 * This runs at release-staging time against a freshly installed oxfmt in a
 * throwaway workdir; the committed tree is never touched.
